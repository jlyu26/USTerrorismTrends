Also destroyed was the South Tower of the World Trade Center Complex in New York City, which collapsed as a result of the impact and subsequent fire. The building's collapse undoubtedly damaged the foundation of nearby buildings, including the North Tower. Businesses located in the South Tower suffered massive economic losses. Air travel was restricted or prevented in the United States for several months following the attacks. Total losses to the United States Airline industry are unknown, but extremely high. Several major United States airlines were nearly bankrupted in the aftermath of the attacks. The attacks had a massive impact on the U.S. and world economy.","This attack was one of four related incidents (cf. 200109110004-07). Flight attendant, Robert Fangman, called a United Airlines office in San Francisco and spoke with Marc Policastro. He reported the hijacking and said that both pilots had been killed. He also reported that a flight attendant was stabbed and said that the hijackers were flying the plane. United Flight 175 departed from Boston's Logan International Airport at 8:14 am local time. At 8:47 am, air traffic control received the first indications that the plane was hijacked. Since the airplane impacted the South Tower at 9:03 am, the length of the hijacking was at least 16 minutes. The second aircraft seized was United Airlines flight 175, which was scheduled to depart from Logan at 8:00 and fly directly to Los Angeles.","United States Government, The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.
